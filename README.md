# Local-First Development Examples

This repository contains multiple example projects showcasing different approaches to building **local-first applications**. Local-first software gives users agency over their data while providing fast, responsive user experiences that work offline and sync seamlessly across devices.

## What is Local-First?

Local-first applications prioritize:

- **Fast performance** - Data is stored locally for instant interactions
- **Offline capabilities** - Apps work without network connectivity
- **Data ownership** - Users control their data
- **Real-time collaboration** - Changes sync automatically across devices
- **Resilience** - No single point of failure

### üîå [Electric SQL Examples](./lofi-zero/electric-sql/)

**Tech Stack:** Electric SQL, React, PostgreSQL

Direct integration with Electric SQL for PostgreSQL-based local-first applications.

**Key Features:**

- Postgres-compatible local database (SQLite)
- Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
- Partial replication with shapes
- Works with existing Postgres databases
- Rich querying capabilities with SQL

**Use Cases:**

- Existing PostgreSQL applications
- Complex relational data models
- Applications requiring SQL queries
- Enterprise data synchronization

## Getting Started

Each project contains its own README with detailed setup instructions. Here's a general approach:

1. **Choose your stack** based on your requirements:

   - **Zero**: Best for real-time multiplayer apps
   - **TanStack DB + Electric**: Best for complex data queries and full-stack TypeScript
   - **TinyBase**: Best for lightweight, simple applications
   - **Convex**: Best for rapid prototyping with backend features
   - **Legend State**: Best for performance-critical React apps
   - **Electric SQL**: Best for existing PostgreSQL applications

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd [project-name]
   ```

3. **Follow the project-specific README** for installation and setup

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Flow Patterns

- **Optimistic Updates**: Changes applied locally first, then synced
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of concurrent edits
- **Real-time Sync**: Live updates across all connected clients
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without network connectivity

### Common Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, IndexedDB
- **Sync**: WebSockets, HTTP streaming, operational transforms
- **Authentication**: JWT, better-auth, custom solutions
